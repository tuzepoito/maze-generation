# Maze Generation

This is an interactive example of different maze generation algorithms in JavaScript.

They are based on graph theory, more specifically algorithms that generate [minimum spanning trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) and are adapted to generate mazes, by considering the graph as a square grid of points connected by edges of random weights.

So far, the algorithms at display are:
- [Prim–Jarník algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)
- [Kruskal's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm)
- [Depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
